1.1: Exoplanet detection; Blackholes gravitation; Quantum computing algorithms; Mathematic models of birds; Gravitational waves
1.2: The NASA Exoplanet Archive for exoplanet detection; The “Black Hole – Black Hole Waveform Catalog” for blackholes detection; The “Black Hole – Black Hole Waveform Catalog” for Quantum computing
1.3: I can use python to build up a gravitational model for blackholes
1.4: Dream: calculate detailed data of a blackhole from its nearby planets' dynamic; build a simple model which contains just 1 blackhole and a planet.
